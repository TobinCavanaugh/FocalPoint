### Trapped in an abandoned mine after the entrance collapsed, you must escape from a wendigo, taking advantage of the tools left behind by the miners.
The moment to moment gameplay consists of searching for gas canisters, delivering four of them to the generator, and eventually making your way into the elevator, all while avoiding the horrifying native american legend.
