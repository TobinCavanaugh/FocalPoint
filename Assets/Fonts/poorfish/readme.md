an approximation of my “best behaviour”
handwriting,
[scanned](http://scruss.com/blog/2010/05/09/creating-a-truetype-font-from-your-handwriting-with-your-scanner-your-printer-and-fontforge/ "scanned") (kinda) in 2010. Yes,
my handwriting's this irregular. See, not all font nerrrds have
amazing handwriting.

## Name

As I wrote in 2010: “I would like to apologise to the fish of my
aquarium, as I was designing this when I should have been cleaning the
tank. This is dedicated to those brave, wiggly souls.” (Most of them
are still extant in early 2017, btw.)

## Coverage

Quite a bit of western European coverage. The atrocious kerning comes
for free.

## Design Size

Nominally 12 pt, but my real handwriting is closer to 18 pt. (And no,
this looks nothing like my everyday handwriting.)


## Variants

Just Regular for now. Eventually you'll get Fontforge-converted bold and
italic, but don't wait up for them.

## Source

Source to all fonts is included in FontForge format.

pretty bad.
